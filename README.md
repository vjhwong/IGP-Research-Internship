# IGP Research Internship
As a Research Intern at the Department of Immunology, Genetics, and Pathology, I contributed to a project exploring the application of deconvolution techniques. My focus was on estimating cell-type fractions in bulk RNA-seq data.

The repository contains the notebooks I used for data analysis. The data clinical tumor data. I researched the SIA indicator described in this article [The Lancet - Article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00017-8/fulltext#:~:text=By%20combining%20the%20prognostic%20information,%2Dof%2Dart%20immune%20score.)
